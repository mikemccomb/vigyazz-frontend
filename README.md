# Vigyázz

Vigyázz will be an app designed to help users plan travel, particularly travel that could be multi-city or multi-national.

![Vigyazz v0 demo](https://github.com/mikemccomb/vigyazz-frontend/assets/52894341/377aee36-1aef-44e8-849a-a6867ac72806)

Users can sign up for an account to create a dashboard for their trip. Each location a user saves will show information such as weather, the current time in that location, and what the current exchange rate is if a different currency is in play.
